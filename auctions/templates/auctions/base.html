                ClassLancer is a platform designed to allow students to seamlessly become teachers or students based on their
                current needs. Students can create classes corresponding to their academic strengths that can help other students gain a better understanding of those very subjects,
                while also being able to sign up for classes that focus on their weaker subjects. Thus, this makes ClassLancer a dynamic platform that focuses on providing convenience to users
                who wish to enhance their learning by either choosing to teach or learn. All of our tutors go through a verification process, and are certified before they are allowed to create classes.
                So what are you waiting for? Embark on your learning journey with us!

                <h4>App Development</h4>
                <p>
                  Aditya graduated from SJI International, and currently serves as National Service as an administrative assistant
                  in the Singapore Armed Forces. Acknowledging the increasing influence of technology in modern
                  day-to-day life, he will soon pursue Computer Science at the National University of Singapore.
                  Having completed multiple online courses after graduating from high school, Aditya is an
                  advocate for online learning, with which he believes the possibilities are endless. As an
                  avid footballer himself, Aditya often spends his free time either hitting the gym, kicking around on
                  a football pitch, or watching his favorite club, Manchester United, in their games.

                  Ee Jin graduated from ACS (Independent), and is currently studying at the Lee Kong Chian School
                  of Medicine in Nanyang Technological University. Apart from his passion for medicine, Ee Jin has always had
                  a strong interest in technology and especially in the area of MedTech in which he believes there exists a wealth of
                  untapped potential. Ee Jin has also dabbled in his fair share of computer science courses but
                  leaves most of the web development to the experts (Adi and Yash). Apart from studying and managing
                  the marketing and business aspect of ClassLancer, Ee Jin often spends his free time playing water
                  polo, cooking and baking.

                  As an avid follower of Formula 1 and the Aerospace industry, Yash is somebody who enjoys exploring new technologies.
                  Recognising the growing worldwide influence of technology, Yash intends to pursue Computer Science at the National University of Singapore in order to
                  gather all the tools to contribute to this exciting industry. He too has completed Computer Science courses that have allowed him to be able to build
                  the website you see on your screen. Yash enjoys meeting new people, working out and experimenting with making personal vlogs.

                Sometimes, circumstances lead you to meet people you would have never expected to meet.
                But life happens. Aditya and Ee Jin were first introduced to each other while completing their Basic Military
                Training (BMT)  at the start of their 22 months of National Service. Over the course of 2
                months on Tekong Island, they not only became closest friends, but also discovered that they
                had a shared passion for creating something using technology that would positively impact the
                lives of others. Aditya and Ee Jin kept in touch even after their BMT, constantly discussing
                proposals with dreams of making it big. During this time, Aditya bumped into Yash, with whom he spent only about 15 minutes before discovering
                that Yash too shared a similar passion. They also realised that they would be attending the same
                course at the same university in 2 years time. Inevitably, they started to get closer and closer,
                until one day Aditya recognized the opportunity in introducing Ee Jin and Yash to each other. The trio debated possible startup ideas for months, rejecting over 30 suggestions until eventually
                agreeing upon the concept of ClassLancer, which today they proudly call a company of their own.
